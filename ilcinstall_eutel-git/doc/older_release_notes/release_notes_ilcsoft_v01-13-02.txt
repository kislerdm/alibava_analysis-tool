 New packages added in v01-13-02

========================================


 PathFinder : v00-01-00 (I. Heinze)

    Pathfinder is a package which provides a track finding algorithm using Hough transformation and was written to find tracks in TPC prototype data.
    It takes hits (points in 3D space) as input and it can find straight tracks as well as helicoidal tracks.
    For more information see http://www-flc.desy.de/flc/flcwiki/PATHFINDER

 MarlinReco : v01-00-01
================================

    - FPCCDDigi
      - Fixed setting of the cov matrix values.
      - Modified to make link to mcp only for single particle event.

     FullLDCTracking_MarlinTrk:     Fixed situation where, although more that 3 hits are excepted for fitting,
                    less than 3 actually are included in the fit, by the kalman filter.

     SimpleCylinderDigiProcessor:   New - Uses simple gaussian smearing for cylinders.

     TruthTracker:          Fixed bug in SimTrackerHitSortPredicate.

================================
 MarlinTPC : v00-09-01
================================

Patch release

Additions:

+ Added PathFinder (hough trafo track finder project), including an example; will be installable also via ilcinstall
+ An interface processor to PathFinder
+ Added a new example with the reconstruction, up to track finding of the data acquired with the DESY GEM module

+ Added a new tool called TPCConditions2LCCD which will write in the condition database a TPCCondition object based on a text file provided by the user
+ Created a couple of new processor to elaborate the data at the raw level:
    RawDataCutterProcessor will shrink the effective time window of the raw data cutting from them all the pulses or part of those pulses that are coming some time after the maximum possible drift time. This value can be calculated by the processor using condition data or can be overridden by the user
    PedSubRawDataFilterProcessor is a conditional processor that will select an event based on the amount of pulses in an event and the average amplitude of these pulses. It can be useful to perform an event preselection based on these parameter or to subdivide the sample in two event classes to process with different algorithms (noise and data samples for example)
+ Added the RowCutApplicationProcessor developed by Martin Ljunggren from Lund to remove all the hits from a specific pad row

Changes:
o Added TrackerRawData to LCObjectCopier
o Several improvements and bug fixes in the digitisation:
o Moved theTrackerRawDatatoDataConverterProcessor to the general subfolder from the padbased subfolder
o Removed duplicate entry of ADD_MARLINTPC_LIBDIR( ./reconstruction/photoelectric ) from CMakeLists.txt file.
o GenericADCElectronicsParameters class:
o Added 2 bool values: PedestalSubstracted, ZeroSupressed. 
o Adjusted SignalDigitisationProcessor.cc to handle the modified class correctly.
o ADCElectronicsListener:
o Extended to handle the two new bool values of the GenericADCElectronicsParameters.
o PulseFinder upgraded to include overflow information after pedestal subtraction


Bug fixes
- added the value of cosine for track connection as a parameter in TrackMergerProcessor
- Fixed bug in a cast in the TPCConditionsListener.
- Small modification in the tool to convert the ALTRO Raw data file to LCIO which will store the version of the converter in the final file in the x.x.x format
- Corrected some typos in multiple processor documentations
- Modified the CMake file to solve a compilation problem caused by the reference to a tool not present in the repository
- added <algorithm> needed for gcc 4.4.3
- made reconstruction_curler and reconstruction_straight_tracks examples work again

For a full and detailed list of changes, refer to the log.

     =================================

       I. Improvements of the VXD driver

      II. New version of Analogue Hadron Calorimeter for ILD with Videau geometry 
          of the Barrel.

     III. Definition of a new development detector model

     =================================

     Please note that:

        This Mokka release co-works with Geant4 9.4 (and 9.4.patch01) and
        CLHEP 2.1.0.1

        It was tested against GEAR r386 and LCIO v02-00-pre00, gcc 3.4.6 and 4.1.2, 
        SL4 and SL5.

     =================================

       I. Improvements of the VXD driver

          Thanks to Georgios Gerasimos Voutsinas, we have now a new and more 
          realistic VXD implementation, following the description made by 
          Yasuhiro Sugimoto (details at 
          http://llr.in2p3.fr/~musat/VXD/YasuhiroSugimoto/VTX_design110823.pdf). 

          Currently only the inner part pf the VXD is improved.

          In the mokka steering file, this sub-detector can be switch on with
         
         /Mokka/init/subDetector vxd07


      II. New version of Analogue Hadron Calorimeter for ILD with Videau geometry 
          of the Barrel.

          Thanks to Shaojun Lu we have a new driver SHcalScV01 for the AHCal with
          the Barrel geometry suggested by Henri Videau. It has a new sensitive 
          detector for the 'A la Videau' barrel filled with scintillator sensitive 
          layers. The endCap and endCapRing are identical to SHcalSc03.

          In the mokka steering file, this sub-detector can be switch on with
         
         /Mokka/init/subDetector SHcalScV01


     III. Definition of a new development detector model

 CED : v01-04
================================

    - New features (H. Hoelbe, DESY):
        * Add screenshot function
            - Select screenshot from popup menu, resolution options depending on the size of your glced window.
              This will save a screenshot under /tmp/glced.tga.
              To convert the screenshot into a compressed format Use for example "convert /tmp/glced.tga screenshot.png".
        * New help frame
            - New concept: not a extra window. Insteat a orthogonal projection inside of the original ced window
              this should fix: focus problems, crashes, and its transparence now
            - Detector and data layer now also have a visibility field which is shown
            - Help frame now change its size in hight so that always all elements fit into it

        * Removed grafical artifact in detector components who have differ amount of inner and outer edges
        * Outer line of detector are now smooth and are drawn at least to remove a grafical artifact
        * Add fading into the background color for bigger distance as a menu feature.
        * New order of popup menu items
        * Add some new shortcut keys
        * Add 4 extra slots to save user settings
        * fixed typo S for F and added brackets for ((a && b) || (c && d))  if condition
        * renamed MAX_LAYER to CED_MAX_LAYER in order to avoid name clashes with other tools (e.g. calice event display )



================================
 CEDViewer : v01-04
================================

    - Added option to supply limits to helix drawing, other than the extent of the TPC
    - Added option for drawing MC truth info for particle gun events
    - switched to TPC drawing with surfaces and cuts

    - adopted steering example steering files:
       - renamed ChannelMapperProcessor to ChannelMappingProcessor
       - changed raw data file pathes on afs

    - changed parameter DrawHelixForTrack to int:
       draw a helix for Track objects:
       0 none, 1: atIP, 2: atFirstHit, 3: atLastHit, 4: atCalorimeter

    - changes in DSTViewer processor:
      - code cleanup
      - use streamlog instead of cout
      - added parameter DrawDetectorID
      - this processor needs to be revisited ....

    - added parameter MCParticleEnergyCut
    - fixed drawing of neutrals
         - neg. pz particles where drawn in wrong direction
         - start drawing particles at their vertex
    - added lightgrey color for neutrinos

    - added drawing of TrackerHitPlanae and TrackerHitZCylinder

    - added various color schemes for displaying particles, tracks and clusters
      -> steering parameter ColorScheme
    - print evt/run numbers at the end of the event

    - cmake changes:
        - added cmake policy CMP0008
        - removed obsolete install of header files



================================
 MarlinUtil : v01-05
================================

    - added drawing of the SET
    - added picking print funtions for TrackerHitPlane and TrackerHitZCylinder
    - changed drawing of SIT to 3D shape with surface
    - modified to match change of MAX_LAYER to CED_MAX_LAYER in ced_cli.h (requires CED 1.4)
    - added plannar SIT and protected against Gear exceptions for missing parameters



================================
 MarlinTrk : v01-01
================================

    - Support for KalDet Multilayer added
     - Added calo face to support detector
     - Made use of new method in  ILDVMeasLayer "getIntersectionAndCellID"
     - Change GetMLName to GetName in line with KalTest
     - Fixed phi range of helixtrack
     - MarlinKalTestTrack fixed definition of phi0 in  initialise(TS& ts)
       corrected conversion from LCIO to KalTest track parameters in initialise



================================
 MarlinReco : v01-00
================================

    - General
      - New release for preparation for the DBD.

    - Added hybridEcalSplitter (K. Kotera)

    - SiStripDigi: Processor to digitize and clusterize hits for the FTD subdtector
                       First release of the code, still missing full validation; (J. Duarte)

    - VTXDigiProcessor: corrected smearing to be along ladder, previously it was incorrectly perpendicular to the ladder,
                            due to the use of the ladders phi angle instead of it angle of inclination

    - FPCCDDigitizer: Fixed bug in helix approximation.- in previous version the intersection between particle and ladder
                          could be rotated to the opposite side.

        - RecoMCTruthLinker: Bug fix: protect against undefined mother pointer (T.Tanabe )
                 Modified to be able to use TrackerHit relations, though not yet the default.
                 Enable by setting UseTrackerHitRelations true in steering file

    - TPCDigiProcessor: Corrected problem where hits from alternative z halves could be considered to be adjacent
                Removed SimHits from RawHits and Used Relations. The deprecated feature to store them in the
                rawhits can be enabled by setting UseRawHitsToStoreSimhitPointer true.
