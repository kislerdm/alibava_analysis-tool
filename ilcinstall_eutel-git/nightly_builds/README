# Python script for using ilcinstall to
# perform nightly builds and send a mail
# with the output to a list of users

How to use:

1st:    copy nbuild script to directory where ilcsoft-install is located (cp nbuild ../)
        edit the nbuild script and check if the settings meet your needs
        * mail_addresses can also be set in the config file

2nd:    use the template nb-debug.cfg and adapt it to your needs

3rd:    create your cronjob

        # configure crontab for current user
        $ crontab -e

        # example of a crontab file
        SHELL=/bin/bash
        # enter your email here for receiving output from cron jobs
        MAILTO=your_email@blah.zzz
        # for downloading the sources for the nightly builds, the cron user (used by the cronjob)
        # needs to access some settings:
        # for cvs downloads: $HOME/.cvspass
        # for svn downloads with p12 certificate: $HOME/.subversion/servers and $HOME/.globus/usercert.p12
        # if this settings are located in afs the cronjob needs an afs token to access them.
        # the easiest way is to use k5crontab to define the cronjobs instead (just call k5crontab -e)
        # if you do not have k5crontab then you need to relocate the HOME directory of cron to a non-afs
        # directory and copy the needed settings to this directory.
        # HOME=/scratch/cronhome
        # some additional paths may be needed
        # PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
         
        # cron syntax is:
        # mm hh MM YY dd
        #
        # examples:
        # 00 * * * *    every hour (X:00)
        # 30 2 * * *    dayly @ 2:30
        # 00 4 * * 1    weekly (mondays @ 4:00)
        # 15 2 1 * *    monthly (1st of the month @ 2:15)
        # 00 5 * * 1-5  workdays @ 5:00
       
        # run daily at 2:00
        00 2 * * * cd /path/to/ilcinstall && ./nbuild ./nightly_builds/nb-debug.cfg
